Since 2nd grade i have been going to frisco schools so i have know the same people for my whole life… which kinda sucks like COMPLETELY i don't really get to meet anyone really new. This summer i turned 18 YAY!! Ikr that’s how i'm supposed to feel but i really don't feel any different, i feel the same just able to actually go to jail for things and am able to vote. None of the real fun stuff… that starts when i'm 21…

 Ever since i was younger i loved music different forms of music but i never really noticed. I use to express myself through dance when i was in elementary school bc i felt like it was the only way how but soon grew out of that. When i reached middle school i express myself the saxophone i really loved that but i got irritated with the band director bc they were treating me unfair so... i quite that!! in highschool(which i still go to) i took on theatre and acting was alright but when we got to musicals i really loved it and loved singing but things went down and the second year of theatre i decided to let it go. I had no other form of art that involved music so i was at lost of what to do. One day i was sitting in my room reflecting on the past year and started writing down my thoughts, that in return turned into a song... I FIGURED OUT I COULD WRITE MUSIC!!! that was a different outlet and the best of them all bc i am able to control my creativity and it was also a way to relieve stress. From then on i started writing music and soon going to make music... HOPE YOU ENJOYED THIS PARAGRAPH!!!

  I first discovered shailene Woodley on the tv show the secret life of the american teenager(im acting like i actually discovered her..HA LOL... NO). I walked in on my sister watching it and she wouldnt give up the romote soo i decided to watch it with her... Long story short i loved the show and grew a liking towards shailene and her acting. I then started watching more and more of her movies and loved how good she was at what she did so i decided she was going to become my fav actress. I love her in divergent and her newest movie Adrift(yes that was a plug go see it she killed it in that movie... GO SEE IT). I just think overall she is an amazing actress and also she is a amazing person off the camera too soooooooooo yeah she should be your favorite too. Yeah.. so this is the rant of my fangirling over shailene and her amazing acting... you are probably annoyed but idrc... HOPE U LIKED THIS RANT(you better have.)
